# Rocket Elevator Blockchain
Hi this is my project for the 12th week of our cohort. We created an app, you can click [here](https://afternoon-waters-45623.herokuapp.com/) and as you can see, you are able to mint our NFT created with the HashLips template! You can mint using ETH or Rocket Tokens!

# How to use
You can use the app locally by running the command `npm install` and then`npm run start` so you should be able to run the website locally.
Also you will need to deploy the contract on the Rinkeby network and insert the website etherscan the address you got when you verify that the contract is really yours.

# Function
The website should have a pre-sale cost so the december 24th at 9AM the real sale should start and the price would be higher than the pre sale.
The token will reveal itself the december 27th at 1pm!

Have fun testing and have a wonderful christmas!
